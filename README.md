Also we will try to help the company to solve the problem by identifying employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

3. There are total of 1549 employees are eligible to join the mentoring program.

4. The mentorship_eligibilty data only contains employees who were born between January 1,1965 and December 31, 1965

## Summary:

1. There are 90938 employees are retiring so we need to hire people to cover these employees to get through the silver tsunami.

2. There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. We shouldn't choose the mentors base on their age, instead we should choose base on their seniority or how long they've worked for the company.
